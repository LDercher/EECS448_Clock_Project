# EECS448_Clock_Project

Group project #2 for EECS 448 - Software Engineering I at the University of Kansas

Continuing to work on Team 14 (Victor Berger, Jesse Yang, Jeromy Tsai, Cammy Vo)'s project, we are adding new functionalities to the clock: Timer, stop watch modes and calendar display.  

The clock is implemented in Java and its Swing GUI.
